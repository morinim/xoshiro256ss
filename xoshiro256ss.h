/// The main 64-bit proposal for an all-purpose, rock-solid generator is
/// xoshiro256**. It has excellent speed, a state space that is large enough
/// for any parallel application, and passes all tests we are aware of. While
/// specified using multiplications, it can be implemented using only a few
/// shifts, xors and sums (rotations can be implemented with shifts, when not
/// directly available).
///
/// There are however some cases in which 256 bits of state are considered too
/// much, for instance when throwing a very large number of lightweight
/// threads, or in embedded hardware. In this case a similar discussion applies
/// to xoroshiro128+, with the caveat that the latter has mild problems with
/// the Hamming-weight dependency test: however, bias can be detected only
/// after 8TB of data, which makes it unlikely to affect in any way
/// applications.
